# Face_Identification_With_Database
Face identification algorithms focus on the identifiction of frontal human faces. It is analogous to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit. Image matches with the image stores in database. Any facial feature changes in the database will invalidate the matching process. It's mostly use for the security.
